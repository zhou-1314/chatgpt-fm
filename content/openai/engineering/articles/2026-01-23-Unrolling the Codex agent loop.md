__Codex CLI__(opens in a new window) is our cross-platform local software agent, designed to produce high-quality, reliable software changes while operating safely and efficiently on your machine. We’ve learned a tremendous amount about how to build a world-class software agent __since we first launched the CLI in April__. To unpack those insights, this is the first post in an ongoing series where we’ll explore various aspects of how Codex works, as well as hard-earned lessons. (For an even more granular view on how the Codex CLI is built, check out our open source repository at __https://github.com/openai/codex__(opens in a new window). Many of the finer details of our design decisions are memorialized in GitHub issues and pull requests if you’d like to learn more.)

To kick off, we’ll focus on the *agent loop*, which is the core logic in Codex CLI that is responsible for orchestrating the interaction between the user, the model, and the tools the model invokes to perform meaningful software work. We hope this post gives you a good view into the role our agent (or “harness”) plays in making use of an LLM.

Before we dive in, a quick note on terminology: at OpenAI, “Codex” encompasses a suite of software agent offerings, including Codex CLI, Codex Cloud, and the Codex VS Code extension. This post focuses on the Codex *harness*, which provides the core agent loop and execution logic that underlies all Codex experiences and is surfaced through the Codex CLI. For ease here, we’ll use the terms “Codex” and “Codex CLI” interchangeably.

At the heart of every AI agent is something called “the agent loop.” A simplified illustration of the agent loop looks like this:

To start, the agent takes *input* from the user to include in the set of textual instructions it prepares for the model known as a *prompt*.

The next step is to query the model by sending it our instructions and asking it to generate a response, a process known as *inference*. During inference, the textual prompt is first translated into a sequence of input __tokens__(opens in a new window)—integers that index into the model’s vocabulary. These tokens are then used to sample the model, producing a new sequence of output tokens.

The output tokens are translated back into text, which becomes the model’s response. Because tokens are produced incrementally, this translation can happen as the model runs, which is why many LLM-based applications display streaming output. In practice, inference is usually encapsulated behind an API that operates on text, abstracting away the details of tokenization.

As the result of the inference step, the model either (1) produces a final response to the user’s original input, or (2) requests a *tool call* that the agent is expected to perform (e.g., “run `ls` and report the output”). In the case of (2), the agent executes the tool call and appends its output to the original prompt. This output is used to generate a new input that’s used to re-query the model; the agent can then take this new information into account and try again.

This process repeats until the model stops emitting tool calls and instead produces a message for the user (referred to as an *assistant message* in OpenAI models). In many cases, this message directly answers the user’s original request, but it may also be a follow-up question for the user.

Because the agent can execute tool calls that modify the local environment, its “output” is not limited to the assistant message. In many cases, the primary output of a software agent is the code it writes or edits on your machine. Nevertheless, each turn always ends with an assistant message—such as “I added the `architecture.md` you asked for”—which signals a termination state in the agent loop. From the agent’s perspective, its work is complete and control returns to the user.

The journey from *user input* to *agent response* shown in the diagram is referred to as one *turn* of a conversation (a *thread* in Codex). Though this *conversation turn* can include many iterations between the **model inference** and **tool calls**. Every time you send a new message to an existing conversation, the conversation history is included as part of the prompt for the new turn, which includes the messages and tool calls from previous turns:

This means that as the conversation grows, so does the length of the prompt used to sample the model. This length matters because every model has a *context window*, which is the maximum number of tokens it can use for one inference call. Note this window includes both input *and* output tokens. As you might imagine, an agent could decide to make hundreds of tool calls in a single turn, potentially exhausting the context window. For this reason, *context window management* is one of the agent’s many responsibilities. Now, let’s dive in to see how Codex runs the agent loop.

The Codex CLI sends HTTP requests to the __Responses API__(opens in a new window) to run model inference. We’ll examine how information flows through Codex, which uses the Responses API to drive the agent loop.

The Responses API endpoint that the Codex CLI uses is __configurable__(opens in a new window), so it can be used with any endpoint that __implements the Responses API__(opens in a new window):

- __When using ChatGPT login__ (opens in a new window) with the Codex CLI, it uses`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` as the endpoint
- __When using API-key authentication__ (opens in a new window) with OpenAI hosted models, it uses`https://api.openai.com/v1/responses` as the endpoint
- When running Codex CLI with `--oss` to use__gpt-oss__  with__ollama 0.13.4+__ (opens in a new window) or__LM Studio 0.3.39+__ (opens in a new window), it defaults to`http://localhost:11434/v1/responses` running locally on your computer
- Codex CLI can be used with the Responses API hosted by a cloud provider such as Azure

Let’s explore how Codex creates the prompt for the first inference call in a conversation.

As an end user, you don’t specify the prompt used to sample the model verbatim when you query the Responses API. Instead, you specify various input types as part of your query, and the Responses API server decides how to structure this information into a prompt that the model is designed to consume. You can think of the prompt as a “list of items”; this section will explain how your query gets transformed into that list.

In the initial prompt, every item in the list is associated with a role. The `role` indicates how much weight the associated content should have and is one of the following values (in decreasing order of priority): `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`.

The __Responses API__(opens in a new window) takes a JSON payload with many parameters. We’ll focus on these three:

__instructions__
__tools__
__input__

In Codex, the `instructions` field is read from the __model_instructions_file__`~/.codex/config.toml`, if specified; otherwise, __the__ __base_instructions__ __associated with a model__(opens in a new window) are used. Model-specific instructions live in the Codex repo and are bundled into the CLI (e.g., __gpt-5.2-codex_prompt.md__

The `tools` field is a list of tool definitions that conform to a schema defined by the Responses API. For Codex, this includes tools that are provided by the Codex CLI, tools that are provided by the Responses API that should be made available to Codex, as well as tools provided by the user, usually via MCP servers:

Finally, the `input` field of the JSON payload is a list of items. Codex __inserts the following items__(opens in a new window) into the `input` before adding the user message:

1. A message with `role=developer` that describes the sandbox that *applies only to the Codex-provided* *shell* *tool* defined in the `tools` section. That is, other tools, such as those provided from MCP servers, are not sandboxed by Codex and are responsible for enforcing their own guardrails.

The message is built from a template where the key pieces of content come from snippets of Markdown bundled into the Codex CLI, such as __workspace_write.md____on_request.md__

2. (Optional) A message with `role=developer` whose contents are the `developer_instructions` value read from the user’s `config.toml` file.

3. (Optional) A message with `role=user` whose contents are the “user instructions,” which are not sourced from a single file but are __aggregated across multiple sources__(opens in a new window). In general, more specific instructions appear later:

- Contents of `AGENTS.override.md` and`AGENTS.md` in`$CODEX_HOME`
- Subject to a limit (32 KiB, by default), look in each folder from the Git/project root of the `cwd` (if it it exists) up to the`cwd` itself: add the contents of any of`AGENTS.override.md` ,`AGENTS.md` , or any filename specified by`project_doc_fallback_filenames in config.toml`
- If any __skills__ (opens in a new window) have been configured:
  - a short preamble about skills
  - the __skill metadata__ (opens in a new window) for each skill
  - a section on __how to use skills__ (opens in a new window)

4. A message with `role=user` that describes the local environment in which the agent is currently operating. This __specifies the current working directory and the user’s shell__(opens in a new window):

Once Codex has done all of the above computation to initialize the `input`, it appends the user message to start the conversation.

The previous examples focused on the content of each message, but note that each element of `input` is a JSON object with `type`, `role`(opens in a new window), and `content` as follows:

Once Codex builds up the full JSON payload to send to the Responses API, it then makes the HTTP POST request with an `Authorization` header depending on how the Responses API endpoint is configured in `~/.codex/config.toml` (additional HTTP headers and query parameters are added if specified).

When an OpenAI Responses API server receives the request, it uses the JSON to derive the prompt for the model as follows (to be sure, a custom implementation of the Responses API could make a different choice):

As you can see, the order of the first three items in the prompt is determined by the server, not the client. That said, of those three items, only the content of the *system message* is also controlled by the server, as the `tools` and `instructions` are determined by the client. These are followed by the `input` from the JSON payload to complete the prompt.

Now that we have our prompt, we are ready to sample the model.

This HTTP request to the Responses API initiates the first “turn” of a conversation in Codex. The server replies with a Server-Sent Events (__SSE__(opens in a new window)) stream. The `data` of each event is a JSON payload with a `"type"` that starts with `"response"`, which could be something like this (a full list of events can be found in our __API docs__(opens in a new window)):

Codex __consumes the stream of events__(opens in a new window) and republishes them as internal event objects that can be used by a client. Events like `response.output_text.delta` are used to support streaming in the UI, whereas other events like `response.output_item.added` are transformed into objects that are appended to the `input` for subsequent Responses API calls.

Suppose the first request to the Responses API includes two `response.output_item.done` events: one with `type=reasoning` and one with `type=function_call`. These events must be represented in the `input` field of the JSON when we query the model again with the response to the tool call:

The resulting prompt used to sample the model as part of the subsequent query would look like this:

In particular, note how the old prompt *is an exact prefix* of the new prompt. This is intentional, as this makes subsequent requests much more efficient because it enables us to take advantage of *prompt caching* (which we’ll discuss in the next section on performance).

Looking back at our first diagram of the agent loop, we see that there could be many iterations between inference and tool calling. The prompt may continue to grow until we finally receive an assistant message, indicating the end of the turn:

In the Codex CLI, we present the assistant message to the user and focus the composer to indicate to the user that it’s their “turn” to continue the conversation. If the user responds, both the assistant message from the previous turn, as well as the user’s new message, must be appended to the `input` in the Responses API request to start the new turn:

Once again, because we are continuing a conversation, the length of the `input` we send to the Responses API keeps increasing:

Let’s examine what this ever-growing prompt means for performance.

You might be asking yourself, “Wait, isn’t the agent loop *quadratic* in terms of the amount of JSON sent to the Responses API over the course of the conversation?” And you would be right. While the Responses API does support an optional __previous_response_id__

Avoiding `previous_response_id` simplifies things for the provider of the Responses API because it ensures that every request is *stateless*. This also makes it straightforward to support customers who have opted into __Zero Data Retention (ZDR)__(opens in a new window), as storing the data required to support `previous_response_id` would be at odds with ZDR. Note that ZDR customers do not sacrifice the ability to benefit from proprietary reasoning messages from prior turns, as the associated `encrypted_content` can be decrypted on the server. (OpenAI persists a ZDR customer’s decryption key, but not their data.) See PRs __#642__(opens in a new window) and __#1641__(opens in a new window) for the related changes to Codex to support ZDR.

Generally, the cost of sampling the model dominates the cost of network traffic, making sampling the primary target of our efficiency efforts. This is why prompt caching is so important, as it enables us to reuse computation from a previous inference call. When we get cache hits, *sampling the model is linear rather than quadratic*. Our __prompt caching__ (opens in a new window)documentation explains this in more detail:

*Cache hits are only possible for exact prefix matches within a prompt. To realize caching benefits, place static content like instructions and examples at the beginning of your prompt, and put variable content, such as user-specific information, at the end. This also applies to images and tools, which must be identical between requests.*

With this in mind, let’s consider what types of operations could cause a “cache miss” in Codex:

- Changing the `tools` available to the model in the middle of the conversation.
- Changing the `model` that is the target of the Responses API request (in practice, this changes the third item in the original prompt, as it contains model-specific instructions).
- Changing the sandbox configuration, approval mode, or current working directory.

The Codex team must be diligent when introducing new features in the Codex CLI that could compromise prompt caching. As an example, our initial support for MCP tools introduced a __bug where we failed to enumerate the tools in a consistent order__(opens in a new window), causing cache misses. Note that MCP tools can be particularly tricky because MCP servers can change the list of tools they provide on the fly via a __notifications/tools/list_changed__

When possible, we handle configuration changes that happen mid-conversation by appending a *new* message to `input` to reflect the change rather than modifying an earlier message:

- If the sandbox configuration or approval mode changes, we __insert__ (opens in a new window) a new`role=developer` message with the same format as the original`<permissions instructions>` item.
- If the current working directory changes, we __insert__ (opens in a new window) a new`role=user` message with the same format as the original`<environment_context>` .

We go to great lengths to ensure cache hits for performance. There’s another key resource we have to manage: the context window.

Our general strategy to avoid running out of context window is to *compact* the conversation once the number of tokens exceeds some threshold. Specifically, we replace the `input` with a new, smaller list of items that is representative of the conversation, enabling the agent to continue with an understanding of what has happened thus far. An early __implementation of compaction__(opens in a new window) required the user to manually invoke the `/compact` command, which would query the Responses API using the existing conversation plus custom instructions for __summarization__(opens in a new window). Codex used the resulting assistant message containing the summary __as the new__ __input__

Since then, the Responses API has evolved to support a special __/responses/compact__ __endpoint__(opens in a new window) that performs compaction more efficiently. It returns __a list of items__(opens in a new window) that can be used in place of the previous `input` to continue the conversation while freeing up the context window. This list includes a special `type=compaction` item with an opaque `encrypted_content` item that preserves the model’s latent understanding of the original conversation. Now, Codex automatically uses this endpoint to compact the conversation when the __auto_compact_limit__

We’ve introduced the Codex agent loop and walked through how Codex crafts and manages its context when querying a model. Along the way, we highlighted practical considerations and best practices that apply to anyone building an agent loop on top of the Responses API.

While the agent loop provides the foundation for Codex, it’s only the beginning. In upcoming posts, we’ll dig into the CLI’s architecture, explore how tool use is implemented, and take a closer look at Codex’s sandboxing model.
